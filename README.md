# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The example shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  The original code lacks proper error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior and poor user experience.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The route handler doesn't handle potential errors during database operations effectively. It fails to check for invalid user IDs and doesn't provide informative error responses to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code.  It includes comprehensive error handling, checking for invalid user IDs and database errors, and returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
